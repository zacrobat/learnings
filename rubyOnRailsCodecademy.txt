What happens when you visit http://localhost:8000 in the browser? Check out the diagram in the browser.

    The browser makes a request for the URL http://localhost:8000.
    The request hits the Rails router in config/routes.rb. The router recognizes the URL and sends the request to the controller.
    The controller receives the request and processes it.
    The controller passes the request to the view.
    The view renders the page as HTML.
    The controller sends the HTML back to the browser for you to see.

This is called the request/response cycle. It's a useful way to see how a Rails app's files and folders fit together.
