  git fetch vs git pull
git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge. You can do a git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking
 branches under refs/remotes/<remote>/. This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads,
 and is safe to do without changing your working copy.
